            <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
            <p>The site follows many modern design trends in terms of its font choice, blocky divisions of elements, and multitude of 
                interactive items and scrolling subsections. It also follows a very simplistic black-and-white color scheme that draws 
                attention more to the content of the page rather than to its visual style.</p>
            
            <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? 
                Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
            <p>Navigation is mostly done through a top hotbar that scrolls down with you as you browse the page, though it compresses itself 
                to maintain page legibility. There are also some less-used links at the bottom of the page that have to do more with contact 
                and support than navigation.</p>

            <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
            <p>The navigation pane at the top is self-explanatory, though I am a little confused about the organization of the actual content 
                blocks on the homepage. There are music reviews, news, op-eds, and blog posts all intermingled, and scrolling down only reveals 
                more articles, half the time without indicating what category they fall into.</p>

            <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
            <p>The layout generally detracts from the site, especially as there are massive banner ads every couple of scrolls that cover up 
                the other content or force it to shift suddenly when they load.</p>

            <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>
            <p>The page itself and all of its embedded content (including the images tied to some of the articles) loaded quickly enough as to 
                not be an issue, but the large and frequent banner ads left large blank spaces throughout the page while loading for multiple 
                seconds after the page itself was accessible and usable.</p>

            <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
            <p>The text was well-sized and in a clearly legible font. The simple white background for the site (and the choice of black for the
                 text color) enhanced the site's clear focus not on itself or its design but rather on its hosted content.</p>

            <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</li>
            <p>Yes, there was a navigation bar at the top of the page that scrolled with the user as they browsed. The navigation was well done, 
                as different subpages hosted well-organized content (in contrast to the sort of slapdash organization of the homepage) and it was 
                easy to find the type of content one might be looking for.</p>

            <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li>
            <p>The site's simple black-and-white theme was consistent across all pages and helped the whole site feel cohesive.</p>

            <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
            <p>This site responded very well to shrinking the browser window, compressing everything on the homepage into a single scrollable 
                column. Honestly I preferred this layout, as the headers denoting which articles were what made a lot more sense when all 
                aligned in the same way. This makes me wonder if perhaps the site was designed for mobile devices first and then adapted for 
                desktop browsers.</p>

            <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
            <p>Pitchfork manages to convey a uniquely modern vibe that directs its users not to wonder at its flair or features but instead 
                to dive deep into the artistic music journalism (and the music itself) that the site hosts.</p>
