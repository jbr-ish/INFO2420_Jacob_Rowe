			<h2 id="begin">How it All Began...</h2>
			<p>
				In 1997, Master Chef Pierre DeBois moved to Utah from New York where he owned and managed a small restaurant called Ma Maison (My Home). 
				His restaurant specialized in French Nouvelle cuisine. Once in Salt Lake City, he realized that the average Utahan doesn't have much 
				appreciation for high cuisine. Pierre and his family were invited to a neighborhood block party one summer and it was there he had his 
				first encounter with Native Cooking of Utah. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pierre noticed how much the locals enjoyed the items brought to this pot luck dinner. They often went back for seconds or thirds. 
				How could he capture this enthusiasm for eating and translate it into his own cooking? In order to answer this question, he began a 
				year long quest to find out the reason for the success of Utah cuisine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pierre discovered there are some things that set apart Utah cooking from others:
				<ul>
					<li>Simplicity in preparation</li>
					<li>Inexpensive ingredients</li>
					<li>Ethnic variations available</li>
					<li>Feeds large amounts of people</li>
					<li>Ease of Serving and Cleanup</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2 id="online">Native Cooking of Utah Goes Online...</h2>
			<p>
				So in 2010, Pierre DeBois began gathering recipes for an online cookbook titled: Native Cooking of Utah. Everywhere he could, he begged, 
				borrowed or stole the secret recipes of popular Utah cooks. Many of these recipes had been handed down from generation to generation. 
				In fact, the most well known recipe for green jello even was honored with its own Olympic pin.
			</p>
			<p>
				The web site for Native Cooking of Utah organizes the recipes by area of the state.  For example, salt water taffy from Salt Lake City, 
				and Bear Lake Raspberry ice cream from Bear Lake. Chef Pierre DeBois has traveled the state to gather these recipes. Read the Guestbook 
				to see comments and testimonials from satisfied cooks.

			<h2 id="future">Looking to the Future...</h2>
			<p>
				Native Cooking of Utah has become one of the most popular cooking sites in the Western U.S. with over 10,000 hits per week. Chef Pierre 
				DeBois has plans to expand the site to include cooking utensils and kitchen accessories used or hand-made by native Utahans. Not only can 
				you use this web site to help you to create true Utahan cuisine, now you can look the part. You will find these added treats online after 
				January, 2013:
